              mutations found in 7\% of gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs)
              but have not been described in childhood acute myeloid leukemia
              (AML). DNA and cDNA from 60 children with AML were screened by
              polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for mutations of the JMD. A
              complex ITD (kit cITD) involving exon 11 and exon 12 was
              identified with a relative frequency of 7\% (4/60). The human kit
              cITDs were inserted into the murine c-Kit backbone and expressed
              in Ba/F3 cells. KIT cITD induced factorindependent growth and
              apoptosis resistance, and exhibited constitutive
              autophosphorylation. KIT cITD constitutively activated the
              PI3K/AKT pathway and phosphorylated STAT1, STAT3, STAT5, and
              SHP-2. Imatinib (IM) or rapamycin (Rap) led to complete

  abstract = "Genomic investigations of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) have
              demonstrated that several genes are recurrently mutated, leading
              to new genomic classifications, predictive biomarkers, and new
              therapeutic targets. Mutations of the FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3
              (FLT3) gene occur in approximately 30\% of all AML cases, with
              the internal tandem duplication (ITD) representing the most
              common type of FLT3 mutation (FLT3-ITD; approximately 25\% of all
              AML cases). FLT3-ITD is a common driver mutation that presents
              with a high leukemic burden and confers a poor prognosis in
              patients with AML. The prognostic value of a FLT3 mutation in the
              tyrosine kinase domain (FLT3-TKD), which has a lower incidence in
              AML (approximately 7-10\% of all cases), is uncertain.
              Accumulating evidence demonstrates that FLT3 mutational status
              evolves throughout the disease continuum. This so-called clonal
              evolution, together with the identification of FLT3-ITD as a
              negative prognostic marker, serves to highlight the importance of
              FLT3-ITD testing at diagnosis and again at relapse. Earlier
              identification of FLT3 mutations will help provide a better
              understanding of the patient's disease and enable targeted
              treatment that may help patients achieve longer and more durable
              remissions. First-generation FLT3 inhibitors developed for
              clinical use are broad-spectrum, multikinase inhibitors; however,
              next-generation FLT3 inhibitors are more specific, more potent,
              and have fewer toxicities associated with off-target effects.
              Primary and secondary acquired resistance to FLT3 inhibitors
              remains a challenge and provides a rationale for combining FLT3
              inhibitors with other therapies, both conventional and
              investigational. This review focuses on the pathological and
              prognostic role of FLT3 mutations in AML, clinical classification
              of the disease, recent progress with next-generation FLT3
              inhibitors, and mechanisms of resistance to FLT3 inhibitors.",

              integrated solution for analysing data from gene expression
              experiments. It contains rich features for handling complex
              experimental designs and for information borrowing to overcome
              the problem of small sample sizes. Over the past decade, limma
              has been a popular choice for gene discovery through differential
              expression analyses of microarray and high-throughput PCR data.
              The package contains particularly strong facilities for reading,
              normalizing and exploring such data. Recently, the capabilities
              of limma have been significantly expanded in two important
              directions. First, the package can now perform both differential
              expression and differential splicing analyses of RNA sequencing
              (RNA-seq) data. All the downstream analysis tools previously
              restricted to microarray data are now available for RNA-seq as
              well. These capabilities allow users to analyse both RNA-seq and
              microarray data with very similar pipelines. Second, the package
              is now able to go past the traditional gene-wise expression
              analyses in a variety of ways, analysing expression profiles in
              terms of co-regulated sets of genes or in terms of higher-order
              expression signatures. This provides enhanced possibilities for
              biological interpretation of gene expression differences. This
              article reviews the philosophy and design of the limma package,

              functionality, thus making their detection vitally important.
              While substantial effort has gone into detecting indels from DNA,
              there is still opportunity for improvement. Further, detection of

              Diagnostic RNA from patients with t(8;21) (N = 17), Inv(16) (N =

              of 1291 genes in t(8;21) and 474 genes in Inv(16) were
              differentially expressed relative to the NK controls, with 198
              genes differentially expressed in both subtypes. The majority of
              these genes (175/198; binomial test p-value < 10(-30)) are
              consistent in expression changes among the two subtypes
              suggesting the expression profiles are more similar between the
              CBF cohorts than in the NK cohort. Our analysis also revealed
              alternative splicing events (ASEs) differentially expressed
              across subtypes, with 337 t(8;21)-specific and 407
              Inv(16)-specific ASEs detected, the majority of which were

              methods and their confidence scores, comparisons between a test

              Unfortunately, these comparisons are not straightforward with the
              current Variant Call Files (VCF), which are the standard output
              of most variant calling algorithms for high-throughput sequencing
              data. Comparisons of VCFs are often confounded by the different
              representations of indels, MNPs, and combinations thereof with
              SNVs in complex regions of the genome, resulting in misleading
              results. A variant caller is inherently a classification method
              designed to score putative variants with confidence scores that
              could permit controlling the rate of false positives (FP) or
              false negatives (FN) for a given application. Receiver operator
              curves (ROC) and the area under the ROC (AUC) are efficient
              metrics to evaluate a test call set versus a gold standard.
              However, in the case of VCF data this also requires a special
              accounting to deal with discrepant representations. We developed
              a novel algorithm for comparing variant call sets that deals with
              complex call representation discrepancies and through a dynamic
              programing method that minimizes false positives and negatives
              globally across the entire call sets for accurate performance

               is a challenging and yet unsolved problem because of the
               non-contiguous transcript structure, relatively short read
               lengths and constantly increasing throughput of the sequencing
               technologies. Currently available RNA-seq aligners suffer from
               high mapping error rates, low mapping speed, read length
               limitation and mapping biases.Results: To align our large (>80
               billon reads) ENCODE Transcriptome RNA-seq dataset, we developed
               the Spliced Transcripts Alignment to a Reference (STAR) software
               based on a previously undescribed RNA-seq alignment algorithm
               that uses sequential maximum mappable seed search in
               uncompressed suffix arrays followed by seed clustering and
               stitching procedure. STAR outperforms other aligners by a factor
               of >50 in mapping speed, aligning to the human genome 550
               million 2 $\times$ 76 bp paired-end reads per hour on a modest
               12-core server, while at the same time improving alignment
               sensitivity and precision. In addition to unbiased de novo
               detection of canonical junctions, STAR can discover
               non-canonical splices and chimeric (fusion) transcripts, and is
               also capable of mapping full-length RNA sequences. Using Roche
               454 sequencing of reverse transcription polymerase chain
               reaction amplicons, we experimentally validated 1960 novel
               intergenic splice junctions with an 80--90\% success rate,
               corroborating the high precision of the STAR mapping
               strategy.Availability and implementation: STAR is implemented as

              characterize malignant tumors with unprecedented resolution. In
              particular for cancer, one is often trying to identify somatic
              mutations--changes specific to a tumor and not within an
              individual's germline. However, false positive and false negative
              detections often result from lack of sufficient variant evidence,
              contamination of the biopsy by stromal tissue, sequencing errors,
              and the erroneous classification of germline variation as
              tumor-specific. RESULTS: We have developed a generalized Bayesian
              analysis framework for matched tumor/normal samples with the
              purpose of identifying tumor-specific alterations such as single
              nucleotide mutations, small insertions/deletions, and structural
              variation. We describe our methodology, and discuss its
              application to other types of paired-tissue analysis such as the
              detection of loss of heterozygosity as well as allelic imbalance.
              We also demonstrate the high level of sensitivity and specificity

              simple multi-seed strategy, called seed-and-vote, for mapping
              reads to a reference genome. The new strategy chooses the mapped
              genomic location for the read directly from the seeds. It uses a
              relatively large number of short seeds (called subreads)
              extracted from each read and allows all the seeds to vote on the
              optimal location. When the read length is <160 bp, overlapping
              subreads are used. More conventional alignment algorithms are
              then used to fill in detailed mismatch and indel information
              between the subreads that make up the winning voting block. The
              strategy is fast because the overall genomic location has already
              been chosen before the detailed alignment is done. It is
              sensitive because no individual subread is required to map
              exactly, nor are individual subreads constrained to map close by
              other subreads. It is accurate because the final location must be
              supported by several different subreads. The strategy extends
              easily to find exon junctions, by locating reads that contain
              sets of subreads mapping to different exons of the same gene. It

              identification of cancer-relevant variants, which is considerably
              complicated by the impurity and heterogeneity of clinical tumor
              samples. We compared the impact of admixture of non-cancerous
              cells and low somatic allele frequencies on the sensitivity and
              precision of 19 state-of-the-art SNV callers. We studied both
              whole exome and targeted gene panel data and up to 13 distinct
              parameter configurations for each tool. We found vast differences

              joint tumor-normal calling with MuTect, EBCall or Strelka for
              whole exome somatic variant calling, and HaplotypeCaller or
              FreeBayes for whole exome germline calling. For targeted gene

              of RNA-seq data analysis by studying an important parameter of
              this technology: the sequencing depth. We have analyzed how
              sequencing depth affects the detection of transcripts and their
              identification as differentially expressed, looking at aspects
              such as transcript biotype, length, expression level, and

              is data-adaptive and nonparametric. Our results reveal that most

              this results in a considerable number of false positives that

              algorithms, filtering strategies, recommendations and thus, also
              in the output. We evaluated eight open-source tools regarding
              their ability to call single nucleotide variants and short indels
              with allelic frequencies as low as 1\% in non-matched
              next-generation sequencing data: GATK HaplotypeCaller, Platypus,
              VarScan, LoFreq, FreeBayes, SNVer, SAMtools and VarDict. We
              analysed two real datasets from patients with myelodysplastic
              syndrome, covering 54 Illumina HiSeq samples and 111 Illumina
              NextSeq samples. Mutations were validated by re-sequencing on the

              In addition we considered two simulated datasets with varying

              cases an identical target region consisting of 19 genes (42,322

              to remove duplicate sequence reads after alignment to the genome

              dependent on sequence coverage available. In terms of

              tools for next-generation DNA sequencers using the functional

              interpretation of the results or which statistical tools are best
              for analyzing the data. An RNA-seq experiment with 48 biological
              replicates in each of two conditions was performed to answer
              these questions and provide guidelines for experimental design.
              With three biological replicates, nine of the 11 tools evaluated
              found only 20\%-40\% of the significantly differentially
              expressed (SDE) genes identified with the full set of 42 clean
              replicates. This rises to >85\% for the subset of SDE genes
              changing in expression by more than fourfold. To achieve >85\%
              for all SDE genes regardless of fold change requires more than 20
              biological replicates. The same nine tools successfully control
              their false discovery rate at ≲5\% for all numbers of replicates,

              six biological replicates should be used, rising to at least 12
              when it is important to identify SDE genes for all fold changes.
              If fewer than 12 replicates are used, a superior combination of
              true positive and false positive performances makes edgeR and
              DESeq2 the leading tools. For higher replicate numbers,

              designs for differential expression detection. Currently, the
              field lacks general methods to estimate power and sample size for
              RNA-Seq in complex experimental designs, under the assumption of
              the negative binomial distribution. We simulate RNA-Seq count
              data based on parameters estimated from six widely different
              public data sets (including cell line comparison, tissue
              comparison, and cancer data sets) and calculate the statistical
              power in paired and unpaired sample experiments. We
              comprehensively compare five differential expression analysis
              packages (DESeq, edgeR, DESeq2, sSeq, and EBSeq) and evaluate
              their performance by power, receiver operator characteristic
              (ROC) curves, and other metrics including areas under the curve
              (AUC), Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC), and F-measures.
              DESeq2 and edgeR tend to give the best performance in general.
              Increasing sample size or sequencing depth increases power;
              however, increasing sample size is more potent than sequencing
              depth to increase power, especially when the sequencing depth
              reaches 20 million reads. Long intergenic noncoding RNAs
              (lincRNA) yields lower power relative to the protein coding
              mRNAs, given their lower expression level in the same RNA-Seq
              experiment. On the other hand, paired-sample RNA-Seq
              significantly enhances the statistical power, confirming the
              importance of considering the multifactor experimental design.
              Finally, a local optimal power is achievable for a given budget
              constraint, and the dominant contributing factor is sample size
              rather than the sequencing depth. In conclusion, we provide a

              millions of short sequence reads, which are usually aligned to a
              reference genome. In many applications, the key information
              required for downstream analysis is the number of reads mapping
              to each genomic feature, for example to each exon or each gene.
              The process of counting reads is called read summarization. Read
              summarization is required for a great variety of genomic analyses
              but has so far received relatively little attention in the
              literature. RESULTS: We present featureCounts, a read
              summarization program suitable for counting reads generated from
              either RNA or genomic DNA sequencing experiments. featureCounts
              implements highly efficient chromosome hashing and feature
              blocking techniques. It is considerably faster than existing
              methods (by an order of magnitude for gene-level summarization)

              understand the genomic landscape of CBF-AMLs, we analyzed both
              pediatric (n = 87) and adult (n = 78) samples, including cases

              recurrent stabilizing mutations in CCND2, suggesting a previously

              signaling alterations, RUNX1-RUNX1T1 and CBFB-MYH11 AMLs
              demonstrated remarkably different spectra of cooperating

              DHX15 and ZBTB7A, as well as an enrichment of mutations in
              epigenetic regulators, including ASXL2 and the cohesin complex.

              tumor-normal pairs. Unlike most current approaches, our algorithm
              reads data from both samples simultaneously; a heuristic and
              statistical algorithm detects sequence variants and classifies
              them by somatic status (germline, somatic, or LOH); while a
              comparison of normalized read depth delineates relative copy

              sequence data from 151 high-grade ovarian tumors characterized as
              part of the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). We validated some 7790

              used for diagnosis and targeted therapy. Mutations are primarily
              detected from tumor DNA. As dynamic molecules of gene activities,
              transcriptome profiling by RNA sequence (RNA-seq) is becoming
              increasingly popular, which not only measures gene expression but
              also structural variations such as mutations and fusion
              transcripts. Although single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) can be
              easily identified from RNA-seq, intermediate long
              insertions/deletions (indels > 2 bases and less than sequence
              reads) cause significant challenges and are ignored by most
              RNA-seq analysis tools. This study evaluates commonly used
              RNA-seq analysis programs along with variant and somatic mutation
              callers in a series of data sets with simulated and known indels.
              The aim is to develop strategies for accurate indel detection.
              Our results show that the RNA-seq alignment is the most important
              step for indel identification and the evaluated programs have a
              wide range of sensitivity to map sequence reads with indels, from
              not at all to decently sensitive. The sensitivity is impacted by
              sequence read lengths. Most variant calling programs rely on hard
              evidence indels marked in the alignment and the programs with
              realignment may use soft-clipped reads for indel inferencing.
              Based on the observations, we have provided practical
              recommendations for indel detection when different RNA-seq
              aligners are used and demonstrated the best option with highly
              reliable results. With careful customization of bioinformatics

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Less than two percent of the human genome is protein
              coding, yet that small fraction harbours the majority of known
              disease causing mutations. Despite rapidly falling whole genome
              sequencing (WGS) costs, much research and increasingly the
              clinical use of sequence data is likely to remain focused on the
              protein coding exome. We set out to quantify and understand how
              WGS compares with the targeted capture and sequencing of the
              exome (exome-seq), for the specific purpose of identifying single
              nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in exome targeted regions.
              RESULTS: We have compared polymorphism detection sensitivity and
              systematic biases using a set of tissue samples that have been
              subject to both deep exome and whole genome sequencing. The
              scoring of detection sensitivity was based on sequence down
              sampling and reference to a set of gold-standard SNP calls for
              each sample. Despite evidence of incremental improvements in
              exome capture technology over time, whole genome sequencing has
              greater uniformity of sequence read coverage and reduced biases
              in the detection of non-reference alleles than exome-seq.
              Exome-seq achieves 95\% SNP detection sensitivity at a mean
              on-target depth of 40 reads, whereas WGS only requires a mean of
              14 reads. Known disease causing mutations are not biased towards
              easy or hard to sequence areas of the genome for either exome-seq
              or WGS. CONCLUSIONS: From an economic perspective, WGS is at
              parity with exome-seq for variant detection in the targeted
              coding regions. WGS offers benefits in uniformity of read
              coverage and more balanced allele ratio calls, both of which can
              in most cases be offset by deeper exome-seq, with the caveat that
              some exome-seq targets will never achieve sufficient mapped read
              depth for variant detection due to technical difficulties or
              probe failures. As WGS is intrinsically richer data that can
              provide insight into polymorphisms outside coding regions and
              reveal genomic rearrangements, it is likely to progressively
              replace exome-seq for many applications.",

              regions has rapidly demonstrated its utility in genetic studies.
              Inherent in this technology is considerable heterogeneity of
              target coverage and this is expected to systematically impact our
              sensitivity to detect genuine polymorphisms. To fully interpret
              the polymorphisms identified in a genetic study it is often
              essential to both detect polymorphisms and to understand where
              and with what probability real polymorphisms may have been
              missed. RESULTS: Using down-sampling of 30 deeply sequenced
              exomes and a set of gold-standard single nucleotide variant (SNV)
              genotype calls for each sample, we developed an empirical model
              relating the read depth at a polymorphic site to the probability
              of calling the correct genotype at that site. We find that
              measured sensitivity in SNV detection is substantially worse than
              that predicted from the naive expectation of sampling from a
              binomial. This calibrated model allows us to produce single
              nucleotide resolution SNV sensitivity estimates which can be
              merged to give summary sensitivity measures for any arbitrary
              partition of the target sequences (nucleotide, exon, gene,
              pathway, exome). These metrics are directly comparable between
              platforms and can be combined between samples to give ``power
              estimates'' for an entire study. We estimate a local read depth
              of 13X is required to detect the alleles and genotype of a
              heterozygous SNV 95\% of the time, but only 3X for a homozygous
              SNV. At a mean on-target read depth of 20X, commonly used for
              rare disease exome sequencing studies, we predict 5-15\% of
              heterozygous and 1-4\% of homozygous SNVs in the targeted regions
              will be missed. CONCLUSIONS: Non-reference alleles in the
              heterozygote state have a high chance of being missed when
              commonly applied read coverage thresholds are used despite the
              widely held assumption that there is good polymorphism detection
              at these coverage levels. Such alleles are likely to be of
              functional importance in population based studies of rare
              diseases, somatic mutations in cancer and explaining the

              other adult cancers, with an average of only 13 mutations found
              in genes. Of these, an average of 5 are in genes that are

              several of the genes and categories. CONCLUSIONS: We identified
              at least one potential driver mutation in nearly all AML samples
              and found that a complex interplay of genetic events contributes
              to AML pathogenesis in individual patients. The databases from
              this study are widely available to serve as a foundation for
              further investigations of AML pathogenesis, classification, and
              risk stratification. (Funded by the National Institutes of
