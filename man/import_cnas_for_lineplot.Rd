\title{Import copy number variation detected by superFreq for a specific patient}
\usage{
import_cnas_for_lineplot(mutationSummary, patientID, tidy = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{mutationSummary}{a matrix summarising mutations reported by superFreq. Every row is a CN event, every column is a sample and every entry is the VAF for that row mutation for that column sample.}

\item{patientID}{a character vector specifying the patient/s id/s for which mutations have to be imported. This value has to correspond to the names used to save the `mutationSummary` object.}

\item{tidy}{Logical. Should the ouput be in a tidy or untidy (list of matrices) format? Default is `tidy = TRUE`.}
